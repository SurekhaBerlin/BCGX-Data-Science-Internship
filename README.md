**Business Problem**


1. Your client is PowerCo - a major gas and electricity utility that supplies to small and medium sized enterprises.
2. The energy market has had a lot of change in recent years and there are more options than ever for customers to choose from.
3. PowerCo are concerned about their customers leaving for better offers from other energy providers. When a customer leaves to use another service provider, this is called churn.
4. This is becoming a big issue for PowerCo and they have engaged BCG to help diagnose the reason why their customers are churning.
